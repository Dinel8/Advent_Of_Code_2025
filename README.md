# Advent_Of_Code_2025
Repo for Advent of Code puzzles

My first time doing something like this, hoping to solve whatever puzzles I can and learn along the way.

Language: Python, C

## The Plan

1. Use VSCode to create projects for each puzzle
2. Organize each puzzle into separate folders with assigned number
3. Place each folder into another folder titled ```AdventOfCode_Puzzles```
